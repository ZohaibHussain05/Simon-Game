# Simon Game

A simple and fun Simon game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game. The objective of the game is to mimic the increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds generated by the computer.

3. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons.
